    <h1>Sharks are cute</h1>
    <h2>What are sharks?</h2>
    <p>Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on
        the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the
        clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the Batoidea (rays and kin). Some sources extend
        the term "shark" as an informal category including extinct members of Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) with a
        shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. Shark-like chondrichthyans such as Cladoselache and Doliodus first
        appeared in the Devonian Period (419–359 million years), though some fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are
        as old as the Late Ordovician (458–444 million years ago).[1] The oldest modern sharks (selachimorphs) are known
        from the Early Jurassic, about 200 million years ago.(wikipedia)</p>
    <h2>Shark Teeth</h2>
    <p>Shark teeth are embedded in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced
        throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move
        forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of
        tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one
        at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter
        shark.[25]

        Tooth shape depends on the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense and flattened
        teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on
        larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges
        for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional</p>
